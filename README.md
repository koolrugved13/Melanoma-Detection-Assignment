## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.
In cancer, there are over 200 different forms. Out of 200, melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. 
The diagnostic procedure for melanoma starts with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. 
Melanoma skin cancer is highly curable if it gets identified at the early stages
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about 
the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Dataset Information
We have used Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration Data set.
These dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases classes.
All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided
into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
The data set contains the following diseases:

- Actinic keratosis           114 images
- Basal cell carcinoma        376 images
- Dermatofibroma              95  images
- Melanoma                    438 images
- Nevus                       357 images
- Pigmented benign keratosis  462 images
- Seborrheic keratosis        77  images
- Squamous cell carcinoma     181 images
- Vascular lesion             139 images
